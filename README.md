# MockingBird
Mobile app game that will test your memory to mimic the longest tune

## Background
This was the first mobile app I attempted to create. Before committing to its development, I wanted to ensure that the scope of the game was not too large for a solo project and created an outline. This game invites the player to observe ordered auditory and visual cues and then replay them, with increasing difficulty the game tests memory to mimic the longest tune. Your scores are saved in a graph visible in the Settings section of the game.

The project consisted of various aspects: asynchronous programming, 2D sprite asset generation, generalized mobile UI organization, audio asset generation, as well as general design principles.

These aspects constitute the focus of my learning in the development of this project, as there were many things I had to first learn before implementing.
